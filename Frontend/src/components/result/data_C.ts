  "Intro_content":
  `<b style="color:#20948B">You are motivated by peace:</b><br/>
You will do almost anything to avoid confrontation. You enjoy flowing through life without hassle or 
needless irritation. “Feeling” good is innately more important to you than “being” good.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You need kindness:</b><br/>
 while you respond well to thoughtfulness and amiability. You have a strong, silent
 stubbornness that surfaces when you are treated unkindly. You resent being scolded and dislike harsh words.
  You open up to people who are kind and logical but recoil from those who sport hostility. You are tolerant
   of others and patient with their shortcomings.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You enjoy clarity:</b><br/>
. You see experiences in life with tremendous clarity. You observe life’s twists and
 human interactions with powerfully accurate perception. You also enjoy your quiet independence. You say
  very little and others often misinterpret your passivity as ignorance or weakness. Nothing could be further 
  from the truth. You are neither ignorant nor weak. You simply prefer to be asked for your opinion before volunteering it.
Almost arrogantly, you withhold your insights until you value the respect of others, but you rarely
 go out of your way to seek it. You need to be coaxed to talk about your skills, hobbies, and interests.<br/><br/>
 
<b style="color:#20948B">You are independent:</b><br/>
You seek only to avoid being controlled. You simply refuse to be inappropriately dominated. You want
 to do things their own way, in your own time. You don’t ask much of others and resent it when others demand 
 things from you. However, you often comply with unreasonable demands in order to keep the peace and become 
 passive-aggressive by refusing to corporate at a later time on a completely different issue. You express your
  anger and frustration only after you can no longer stand being bossed around.
 You don’t like to be pushed, and you can be fearsome when finally “blow up”.<br/><br/>`
