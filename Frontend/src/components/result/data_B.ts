    "Intro_content":
    `<b style="color:#20948B">You are motivated by altruism:</b><br/>
You love to help others. You seek opportunities to server others, despite personal sacrifice. You are 
uncomfortable doing things solely for yourself. You thrive on social graces and having manners like holding 
doors open for people, standing up when greeting visitors, and acting appropriately in public places.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You enjoy intimacy: </b><br/>
More than anything else, you want to be loved. You will sacrifice a successful career in order to improve an 
important relationship. You are gratified when you are listened to, when you feel understood and appreciated. You are notorious
 for revealing your inadequacies because you value being known and understood by others rather than merely existing in arrogant 
 seclusion. In your view, being vulnerable is small price to pay for intimacy. You suffer more broken hearts than most people, 
 but you also spend more time in love. <br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You need to be appreciated:</b><br/>
With you, a simple pat on the back will not suffice. You expend tremendous effort in “fixing others” and making 
the world” right”. In return, you value knowing that your efforts are appreciated.  You need to be thanked and specially 
remembered for your good deeds.  You value sincere gratitude.  You delight in being remembered on birthdays and other special
 days, especially if the remembrance is personal, such as homemade anniversary card, a welcome home party or any gift with a
  personal touch. You place a high priority on meaningful personal relationships.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You are directed by a strong moral conscience:</b><br/>
You are innately motivated by integrity. You have a moral code that guides you in your decision making, your value 
judgement, and even your leisure time. You enjoy being “good”. Of all the personalities as a group, you come innately equipped
 with the strongest moral principles. You would rather lose than cheat. You value trustworthiness.<br/><br/>
