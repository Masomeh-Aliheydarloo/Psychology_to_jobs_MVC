     "Intro_content":
  `<b style="color:#20948B">You value play:</b><br/>
You consider life to be a party, and you are hosting. Motivated to have fun, you can abandon anything when a 
better offer comes up. You live by the “better offer” theory. In other words, “If it’s better, it should be done;
 and I should be doing it!”<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You welcome praise: </b><br/>
You need to be noticed. Nothing improves a relationship with you more than genuine adoration. You need approval
 and seek to be valued. You often act as though you have the world by the tail. You have your fears, and frustrations,
  which you rarely confide until you know it is safe to do so.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You need intimacy:</b><br/>
You often appear so nonchalant that people think you don’t care about anything. Not true. You need a great deal of attention. 
You are deeply rooted in emotion and like to be stroked. You enjoy touching. To you, physical contact is a direct, comfortable 
connection.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You want to be popular:</b><br/>
You like to be center stage. Looking good socially is very important to them. Friendships command a high priority in your life,
 because social interaction answers your basic need for approval. You are highly verbal and relish good conversations. 
 You are equally comfortable engaging in a heated debate or chit-chatting at a cocktail party.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You crave action:</b><br/>
Easily bored, you seek playful adventure. You cannot sit still for long. You choose friends who, like them, refuse to allow the 
“boring details” to get in the way of their primary reason for living, to play.<br/><br/>
