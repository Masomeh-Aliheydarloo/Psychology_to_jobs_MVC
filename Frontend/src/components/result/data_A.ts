      `<b style="color:#20948B">You seek power:</b><br/>
Simply stated, you want your way. If you have been reared in environments where you were
 able to manipulate your parent and siblings, you become difficult to manage as you get older. 
When you have gotten your way for too long, you find it very difficult to relinquish your power
 and freedom to authorities you meet in society (teachers, bosses, police, clergy, military officers).<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You want to be productive:</b><br/>
You enjoy productivity, whether it is in school, in your careers, or in your personal relationships. You like to get 
the job done. You are often workaholics. 
You will, however, resist being forced to do anything that you are not interested in.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You want to look good to others:</b><br/>
YYou need to appear knowledgeable. You crave approval from others for your intelligence and insight.
 You prefer being respected to being loved. You want to be admired for your logical practical minds.
  When people deal with you, they have to be precise and factual. 
You are unmoved by tears and/or other needless displays of “weakness.”<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You enjoy a good debate:</b><br/>
You usually state the facts as people see you. You seldom say “in my opinion” before stating your opinions. 
While you do enjoy a good power play, you shouldn’t be taken too seriously all the time.<br/><br/>

<b style="color:#20948B">You seek leadership opportunities:</b><br/>
Despite the rigidity of law and the military, you often seek structures where you can eventually experience leadership.
 You like to be in the driver’s seat. What better “driver’s seat” than a judge, a 
politician, or a general? If you can get the upper hand, you will. You are willing to pay a high price in order to lead.   <br/> <br/>
