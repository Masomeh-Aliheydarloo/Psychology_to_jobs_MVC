In essence, a common full-stack setup using MVC principles would involve:
Model: A database (e.g., MongoDB) and an ORM/ODM (e.g., Mongoose with Node.js) to manage data.
View: React.js to render the user interface.
Controller: Node.js with Express.js to handle routes, process requests, and interact with the Model and View.


A few things you can add or improve to be even more "cutting-edge":

Environment Variables: Use .env files with dotenv to manage secrets (DB passwords, ports).

Validation Middleware: Use libraries like Joi or Zod to validate request data before processing.

Type-safe ORM: Consider using ORMs like Prisma or TypeORM for more advanced DB interactions and typings.

Testing: Add automated tests using Jest or similar.

Logging: Use a logging library (Winston, Pino) instead of console.log.

Security: Add security middlewares like helmet [ok], rate limiting, and sanitize inputs.
